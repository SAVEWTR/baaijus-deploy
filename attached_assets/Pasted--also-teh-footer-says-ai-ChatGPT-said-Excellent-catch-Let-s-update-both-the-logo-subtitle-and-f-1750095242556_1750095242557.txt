ChatGPT said:
Excellent catch!
Let’s update both the logo subtitle and footer tagline to remove any “AI” reference.

What to Replace
1. Logo Subtitle
Current:
AI Content Filtering

Replace with one of these (pick your favorite or let me know):

Content Filtering

Content Filtering Made Personal

Personalized Content Filtering

Content You Control

Filtering Made Personal

2. Footer Tagline
Current:
AI-powered content filtering made personal

Replace with:

Content filtering made personal

Personalized content filtering, made for you

Content filtering made for everyone

Content you control, made personal

Or just:

Baaijus – Content filtering made personal

How To Update in React
Logo Area Example:
jsx
Copy
Edit
<div className="logo-area">
  <img src="/logo.png" alt="Baaijus Logo" style={{ height: 38, verticalAlign: "middle" }} />
  <div>
    <div style={{ fontWeight: 700, fontSize: "1.2em" }}>Baaijus</div>
    <div style={{ color: "#888", fontSize: "1em" }}>
      Content Filtering Made Personal
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
Footer Example:
jsx
Copy
Edit
<footer style={{ textAlign: "center", background: "#181b30", color: "#ccc", padding: "2em 0" }}>
  <div>
    <img src="/logo.png" alt="Baaijus Logo" style={{ height: 32, verticalAlign: "middle" }} />
    <span style={{ fontWeight: 600, marginLeft: 8, color: "#fff" }}>Baaijus</span>
  </div>
  <div style={{ fontSize: "1.1em", margin: "0.7em 0 0.2em 0", color: "#bbb" }}>
    Content filtering made personal
  </div>
  <div style={{ fontSize: "0.95em", color: "#888" }}>
    &copy; 2024 Baaijus. All rights reserved.
  </div>
</footer>
Final Touch
Double-check for any “AI” references in meta tags or alt text.

For investor slides, you can always add “Powered by advanced analysis” if needed, but public copy should be timeless and broad.

Copy, paste, and your branding is instantly more universal, premium, and investor/enterprise-ready!
