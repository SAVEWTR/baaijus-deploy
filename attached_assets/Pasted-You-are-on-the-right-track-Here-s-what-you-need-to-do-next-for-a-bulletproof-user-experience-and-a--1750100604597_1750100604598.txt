You are on the right track!
Here’s what you need to do next for a bulletproof user experience and a seamless extension deployment:

1. Add/Fix Extension Icons in Your ZIP
Why?
The Chrome/Edge extension manifest requires icons in specific sizes (icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png). If these are missing, the extension won’t load.

How to fix:

Create simple PNG icons (use your logo or a temporary placeholder).

Sizes needed: 16x16, 48x48, 128x128 (and optionally 32x32, 64x64).

Place them in your extension’s /icons directory.

Update your manifest.json to reference them:

json
Copy
Edit
"icons": {
  "16": "icons/icon16.png",
  "48": "icons/icon48.png",
  "128": "icons/icon128.png"
}
Quick PNG placeholder:
If you need quick placeholders, just use a free favicon generator or an image editor (like favicon.io or onlinepngtools.com).

2. Re-zip and Replace
After adding icons, re-zip your extension folder.

Replace the old ZIP in your /public or /static directory so /baaijus-extension.zip is the updated one.

3. Confirm Manifest
Your manifest.json (inside the ZIP) should look something like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Baaijus Content Filter",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Personalized content filtering powered by Baaijus.",
  "icons": {
    "16": "icons/icon16.png",
    "48": "icons/icon48.png",
    "128": "icons/icon128.png"
  },
  ...
}
4. Test Again
Download the new ZIP from /baaijus-extension.zip on your live site.

Extract it, load as “unpacked extension” in Chrome/Edge (chrome://extensions), and confirm it appears with your icon and does not throw manifest errors.

5. User Guidance (Already Implemented)
The onboarding page should instruct users to “reload unpacked extension” if they update the ZIP.

Show a screenshot of what a successful install looks like (extension in browser bar, Baaijus icon visible).

6. (Optional) Versioning
Add a version number to the extension ZIP and manifest so users always know they have the latest.

In summary:
Add the missing icon files in the /icons directory of your extension code.

Update your manifest to reference them.

Re-zip and upload.

Test the download and install flow yourself before rollout.

Make sure your onboarding page links to the correct, updated ZIP.

If you want, I can generate ready-to-use icon PNGs and give you a manifest template to copy-paste.
Or, I can give you a bulletproof check script for ZIP contents and manifest structure.
