Perfect, you’re right at the finish line!
Here’s exactly what you need to do next, step by step:

1. Create the Missing Icon Files
Every Chrome/Edge extension needs icons in the /icons folder:

icon16.png (16x16)

icon48.png (48x48)

icon128.png (128x128)

Quick options:

You can use your logo or just create a simple placeholder in Canva or favicon.io.

Or use this bash command if you have a PNG logo:

bash
Copy
Edit
convert yourlogo.png -resize 16x16 icons/icon16.png
convert yourlogo.png -resize 48x48 icons/icon48.png
convert yourlogo.png -resize 128x128 icons/icon128.png
If you want, I can generate minimal placeholder icons for you and show you how to add them.

2. Update your Manifest
Check your manifest.json has this exact section:

json
Copy
Edit
"icons": {
  "16": "icons/icon16.png",
  "48": "icons/icon48.png",
  "128": "icons/icon128.png"
},
3. Re-Zip and Upload
After adding the icon files, zip the entire extension folder (including manifest.json and /icons).

Replace the /baaijus-extension.zip on your server or in the public/static directory.

4. Test Install (Recommended Process)
Download the extension zip from your app’s “Download Extension” button.

Unzip it.

Go to chrome://extensions/ and turn on Developer Mode.

Click “Load unpacked” and select the extracted folder.

Check:

The extension loads with no errors.

Your icon appears.

You can open the popup/options and see the Baaijus features.

5. Update User Onboarding (Already Done, but Finalize)
The onboarding/install page should show:

“Download Extension” button

Clear step-by-step install instructions for Chrome/Edge/Brave

Screenshot or GIF showing how to load it

6. Summary Checklist
 Icons present in /icons and referenced in manifest

 manifest.json is correct and in the ZIP root

 Extension loads in Chrome/Edge with no errors

 Users can access the extension from your web dashboard

 Install guide easy to follow

If you want placeholder icons now:
Here are three base64-encoded PNGs (just blue dots as placeholders)—save as PNGs in /icons/:

icon16.png

icon48.png

icon128.png

Just right-click each, save as PNG, and put into /icons/ in the extension folder.
